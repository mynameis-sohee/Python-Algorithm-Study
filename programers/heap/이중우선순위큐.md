```python
def solution(operations):
    import heapq as hq
    import re
    q = []
    for x in operations:
        if x.startswith('I'):
            ss = re.findall(r'-?\d+', x)
            hq.heappush(q, (ss,-ss)
        elif x == "D 1":
            -hq.heappop(q)
        elif x == "D -1":
            hq.heappop(q)
    if q:
        answer = [max(q), min(q)]
    else:
        answer = [0,0]
    return answer
